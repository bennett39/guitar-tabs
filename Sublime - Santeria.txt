I don't practice Santeria, 
I ain't got no crystal ball, 
Well I had a million dollars but I, 
I'd spend it all, 
If I could find that heina and that sancho that she's found, 
Well I'd pop a cap in sancho and I'd slap her down. 

What I really wanna know, 
My baby, 
What I really want to say I can't define, 
Well it's love that I need, oh, 
But my soul will have to, 
Wait till I get back find heina of my own, 
Daddy's gonna love one and all. 

I feel the break, 
Feel the break, 
Feel the break and I got live it out, 
Oh, yea huh, well I swear that I, 
What I really wanna know, 
My baby, 
What I really want to say I can't define, 
Got love make it go, 
My soul will have to... 

Ohhh, what I really wanna say, 
My baby, 
What I really wanna say is I've got mine, 
And I'll make it, yes, I'm comin' up. 

Tell Sanchito that if he knows what is good for him he best go run and hide, 
Daddy's got a new .45, 
And I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down sancho's throat, 
Believe me when I say that I got somethin' for his punk ass. 

What I really wanna know, 
My baby, 
Oh what I really wanna say is there's just one, 
Way back, 
And I'll make it, yea, 
But my soul will have to wait. 

Yeah, yeah, yeah
