[Intro]

E  E   E   E


[Verse]
A              D
Where it began I can’t begin to know it
A                          E
But then I know it’s going strong
A                  D
Was in the spring, and spring became a summer
A                               E
Who’d have believe you’d come along


[Pre-Chorus]
A                      A6
Hands         touching hands
E  D          E
Reaching out touching me  touching you


[Chorus]
A         D            E
Sweet Caroline  Good times never seemed so good
A         D       E
I'd be inclined to believe there never would
D   C#m  Bm
But now I’m


[Verse 2]
A               (E A E)  D
Look at the night        and it don’t seem so lonely
A                       E
We fill it up with only two
A                       D
And when I hurt Hurting runs off my shoulder
A                E
How can I hurt when holding you


[Pre-Chorus]
A             A6
One, touching one
E                                  E
Reachin out touching me touching you


[Chorus]
A        D   (D C# F#)        E
Sweet Caroline          Good times never seemed so good
A         D    (D C# F#)                        E
I'd be inclined          to believe there never would
D   C#m  Bm
Oh no no


[Instrumental]

E  E   E   E


[Pre-Chorus]
A                      A6
Hands         touching hands
E   D       E
Reaching out touching me  touching you


[Chorus]
A         D    (D C# F#)                          E
Sweet Caroline         Good times never seemed so good
A          D   (D C# F#)                      E
I'd be inclined        to believe there never would
D   C#m  Bm  A
Oh no no
