[Intro]

Bbm Ab Gb x2


[Verse 1]

Bbm      Ab       Gb
I won't lie to you
            Bbm       Ab          Gb
I know he's just not right for you


[Pre-Chorus]

            Bbm
And you can tell me if I'm off
      Ab 
But I see it on your face
         Gb
When you say that he's the one that you want
           Bbm  
And you're spending all your time
        Ab     
In this wrong situation
    Gb
And anytime you wanted to stop


[Chorus]

             Bbm        Ab
I know I can treat you better
Gb            Db
  Than he can
                  Bbm    Ab     Gb         Db
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
                    Bbm
Tell me why are we wasting time
                Ab
On all on your wasted crying
                Gb                Db
When you should be with me instead
              Bbm       Ab
I know I can treat you better
Gb
   Better than he can


[Verse 2]

Bbm        Ab        Gb
I'll stop time for you
               Bbm        Ab      Gb
The second you say you'd like me to
Bbm                         Ab
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Gb
Baby, just to wake up with you


[Pre-Chorus]
         Ab                        Ab
Could be everything I need and this could be so different
Bbm
Tell me what you want to do


[Chorus]
                      Bbm      Ab
'Cause I know I can treat you better
Gb            Db
  Than he can
                  Bbm    Ab     Gb         Db
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
                    Bbm
Tell me why are we wasting time
                Ab
On all on your wasted crying
                Gb                Db
When you should be with me instead
              Bbm       Ab
I know I can treat you better
Gb
   Better than he can


Bbm Ab Gb Dsus2
          Better than he can
Bbm Ab Gb Dsus2


[Bridge]

Bbm       Ab
Give me a sign
         Db            Gb
Take my hand, we'll be fine
  Bbm       Ab          Gb
Promise I won't let you down
     Bbm           Ab
Just know that you don't
        Db      Gb
Have to do this alone
  Bbm           Ab         Gb
Promise I'll never let you down


[Chorus]

               Bbm      Ab
I know I can treat you better
Gb            Db
  Than he can
                  Bbm    Ab     Gb         Db
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
                    Bbm
Tell me why are we wasting time
                Ab
On all on your wasted crying
                Gb                Db
When you should be with me instead
              Bbm       Ab
I know I can treat you better
Gb
   Better than he can

Db Ab Gb Dbsus2
          Better than he can
